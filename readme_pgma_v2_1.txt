Public Gamut Mapping Algorithm (PGMA) C Source Code---------------------------------------------------2001 © Ján Morovic-----------Version 2.1-----------Author: Ján Morovic <j_morovic@yahoo.co.uk>Release date: 7 December 2001What are these files?---------------------The files included in this package are the source-code of an implementation of gamut mapping algorithms and gamut calculation algorithms. They are based on the code written during the PhD of Jan Morovic at the Colour & Imaging Institute (University of Derby) entitled: "To Develop a Universal Gamut Mapping Algorithm". For details of that work see: http://colour.derby.ac.uk/~jan/The primary purpose of the public release of this source code is for the use of the CIE Technical Committee 8-03 on Gamut Mapping. For details of its work see: http://www.colour.org/tc8-03/Terms and conditions of use---------------------------Permission is hereby granted for the use of the "Public Gamut Mapping Algorithm (PGMA) C Source Code" for academic and non-profit purposes. To use the code for any other end, written permission needs to be obtained first. If this source code is used in any research or other project, its use needs to be acknowledged by citing:Morovic J.

Included is a modification to the HPMINDE algorithm that removes a bug causing faliure when testing whether centre of gamut is in-gamut.About version 2---------------------------------------This is the first release of the PGMA code made available outside the CIE TC8-03 and it contains implementations of the HPMINDE and SGCK gamut mapping algorithms - the two obligatory GMAs specified in the CIE TC8-03 Guidelines for the Evaluation of Gamut Mapping Algorithms. Functions for performing auxilliary processing (including gamut boundary description) are also included.Files included in this release------------------------------pgma_v2_1.h					PGMA headerpgma_a_v2_1.c					auxiliary functionspgma_a_vgeom_v2_1.c			auxiliary vector geometry functionspgma_gbcalc_v2_1.c			gamut boundary calculation functionspgma_gmas_v2_1.c				gamut mapping algorithm functionspgma_test_v2_1.c				test program using functions in above filesreadme_pgma_v2_1.txt			this readme filetest_data				folder with test data	hpminde_out		hpminde.out		log of data entered to obtain HPMINDE output		ski_hpminde.lab	HPMINDE gamut mapped image in raw Lab format	sgck_out		sgck.out		log of data entered to obtain SGCK output		ski_sgck.lab	SGCK gamut mapped image in raw Lab format	test_input			 		ogamut_m.abl	256 samples from original gamut		rgamut.abl		256 samples from reproduction gamut		ski_256x332.lab	input raw Lab imageNote, the ski image included with this package has been kindly made available by Fujifilm Electronic Imaging Ltd.	Contact details---------------If you have any problems with the code, would like to suggest changes or make any other comments, feel free to contact Jan Morovic at:Dr. Jan Morovicmailto:j_morovic@yahoo.co.ukDisclaimer----------JAN MOROVIC DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS, IN NO EVENT SHALL JAN MOROVIC BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE.
